# MWSUG2025
Thanks for attending my talks while at Midwest SAS User's Group. All files associated with my talks are provided in the folders here. Each talk will have a PDF available and some will have associated Jupyter Notebook files.

Have any follow-up questions? Please contact me at Danny.Modlin@sas.com



## PROC BGLIMM: The Smooth Transition to Bayesian Analysis 

Many analysts are interested in taking models they currently have and transitioning them to the Bayesian realm. Most leap from their favorite classical analysis procedure directly to PROC MCMC, the general-purpose Bayesian procedure. This presentation will feature the BGLIMM procedure available since SAS/STAT 15.1. This will allow the participant to model non-normal responses and include random effects within their Bayesian approach. Discussion will include options of priors and availability of statements. Examples will include models originally written in PROCs REG, GLM, GLMSELECT, GENMOD, MIXED, and GLIMMIX.


## How to Modify SAS9 Programs to Run in SAS Viya

How can existing SAS®9 programs can be modified to execute in SAS Viya. Code can either run as is on the SAS Compute Server, or it can be modernized to process data in memory and in parallel on the SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) server. This presentation is perfect for programmers who are new to SAS Viya and want to continue performing their statistical analyses there. We will address questions that are typically asked. Will existing SAS®9 code work in Viya? How must my programs change to take advantage of the new features in Viya?


## Large-Scale Time Series Forecasting in Model Studio

In this hands-on workshop, you learn to build time series models for large-scale time series problems with many hierarchically related series. You will experience the capability of Model Studio to diagnose, fit, and assess models for many time series at once. Use the new Hierarchical Modeling Node to create time series models at each of the levels of the hierarchy. Need to extract your reconciled predictions from each level of the hierarchy? No problem. Within the Hierarchical Modeling Node, you can dive into each level of the hierarchy and export these desired predictions.
